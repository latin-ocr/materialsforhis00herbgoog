’ {hg 21:00<ng Vol. Ι.) mimz ama translated by Sir ann Eum,

This curious chronicle extends from the sabulone period of history down to the
return of Edward IV . to England in the year 1471 after the second deposition of
Henry VI. The manuscript from which the text of the work is taken is pre-
served in the Imperial Library at Paris, and is believed to be the only complete
and nearly contemporary copy in existence. The work, as originally bound.
vas compr-ised in six volumes, since rebound in morocco in 12 volumes, folio
maximo, vellum, and is illustrated with exquisite miniatnres, vignettes, and initial
letters. It was written towards the end of the fisteenth century, having been
expressly executed for Louis de Bruges, Seigncur de la Gruthu) se and Earl of
winchester, from whose cabinet it passed into the library of Lonis XII . at Blois.

This is one of the many rnedioeval chroniclcs which assume the character of a
history of the world. lt begins with the creation, and is brought down to the
author’s own time, the reign of Edward 111. Preflxed to the historical portion, is
a chapter devoted to geography‚ in which is given a description of every known
land. To say that the Polychronicou vas written in the fourteenth century is to
say that it is not free from inaccuracies. It has, however, a value apart from its
intrinsic merite. It enables us to form a very fair estimate of the knowledge of
history and geography which vell-informed readers of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries possessed, for it was then the standard work on general history.

The two English translations, which are printed with the original Latin, afford

’ interesting illustratione of the gradual change of our language, for one vas made
” in the fourtcenth century, the other in the fifteenth. The differences between
Trevisa’s version and that of the unknown writer are often considerable.

These tvo treatises, though they cannot rank as independent narratives, are
nevertheless valuable as careful abstracts of previous historiens, especially “ Le
nivere de Reis de Engletere.” Some various readings are given which are
interesting to the philologist as instances of semi-Saxonised French. lt is sup-
posed that Peter of Ickham vas the supposed author.

The Abbey of Meanx was a Cistercian house, and the work of its abbot is both
curione and valuable. It is a faithful and osten minute record of the establishrr ent
of a religione community, of its progress in forming an· ample revenue, of its
struggles to maintain its acquisitione, and of its relations to the governing
institutione of the country. In addition to the private affairs of the monastery,
some light is throvn upon the public events ot the time, which are however kept
distinct, and appear at the end of the history of each ahbot‘s administration. The
text has been printed from what is said to be the autogrsph of the original
compilet, Thomas de But-ton, the nineteenth ahhot.

The exact date at which this work was written is, according to the chronic-lor,
1250. The history is of considerable velue as an illustration of the period durirg
which the author lived, and contains a good summaryof the events which followed
