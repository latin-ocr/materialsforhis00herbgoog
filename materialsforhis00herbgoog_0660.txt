The obiect of this work is to publisb notices ot all known sources of British

history, both printed and unprinted‚ in one continued sequence. The materiale,

when historical (as distinguished from biographical), are arranged under the
year in which the latest event is recorded in the chronicle or history, and not
under the period in which its author, reai or supposed, ssourished. Biographies
are enumerated under the year in which the person commemorated died, and not
under the year in which the life was written. This arrangement has tvo
advantagesg the materiale for any given period may be seen at a glanceg and
if the reader knows the time when an author wrote. aud the number of years
that had elapsed-between the date of the events and the time the writer fionrished,
he will generally be enabled to form a fair estimate of the comparative value of
the narrative itself. A brief analysis of each work has been added when deserving
it, in which original portions are distinguished from mere compilations. If
possible, the sources are indicated from which compilatione have been

derived. A biographical sketch of the author of each piece has been added, and
a brief notice of such British authors as have written on historical subjeets.
