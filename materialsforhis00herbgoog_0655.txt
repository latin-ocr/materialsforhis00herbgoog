The first is a poem in Norman French, containing 4,686 lines, addressed to
Alianor, Queen ot' Henry 111„ probably written in 1245, on the restoration of

⁴ the church of Westminster. Nothing is known 'of the author. The second is
an anonymous poem, containing 5361ines, written between 1440 and 1450, by
command of Henry VL, to whom it is dedicated. It does not throw any
new light on the reign of Edward the confessor, but is valuable as a specimen
of the Latin poetry of the time. The third, also by an anonymous author.was
apparently written for Queen Edith, between 1066 and 1074,during the pressure
of the suffering brought on the Saxons by the Nol-man conquest. It notiees
many facts not found in other writers, and some which differ considerably from

the usual accounts.

This work derives its principal value from being the only contemporant-cus
account of the rise of the Lollards. When written, the disputes of the school-
men had been emended to the field of theology, and they appear both in the
writings of Wycliff and in those of his adversaries. Wycdff's little bundles
oi tates are uot less metaphysica] than theological, and the conflict between
Nominalists and Realists rages side by side with the conflict between the different
interpretem of Scripture. The work gives a good idea of the controversies at

the end of the 14th and the beginning of the l5th centul-ies.

This is a metrica} translation of a Latin Prose Chronicle, written in the first
half of the leth century. The narrative begins with the earliest legende and
ends with the death of J ames Ι. of scotland, and the ‘⁸ evil ending of the
traitors that slew him.” Strict accuracy of statement is not to be looked ἰοῖς
butthe stories of the colonisation of Spain, Irelsnd, and Scotland are interesting
if not true, and the chronicle reflecte the manners, sentimenta, and character
of the age in which it was composed. The peculiarities of ,the Scottish dialect
are well illustrated in this version, and the student ot* augum will find mule
materiale for comparison with the English dialects of the same period, and with

modern lowlaud Scotch.
