of Onel college, Oxford. 1868-1871.

This work has long been iustly celebrated, but not thoroughly understood until
Mr. Stubbs’ edition. The earlier portion, extending from 7³2 to 1148, appears
to be a copy of a compilation made in Northumbria about 1161, to which
Hoveden added little. From 1148 to 1169—a very valusble portion of this
work—the matter is derived from another source, to which Hoveden appears to
have supplied little, aud not always judiciously. From 1170 to 1192 is tho
portion which corresponds with the Chroniele known under the name of
Benedict of Peterborough (ses No. ⁴9); hut it is not ι copy, being sometimes
su abridgment, et others a paraphraseg oeensiouelly the tvo work· entirely
sgree3 showing that both writers hed necess to the same materiale, but dealt
with them differently. From 1192 to 1201 may be said to be wholly lloveden's
work s it is extremely valunble, and au authority of the first importanee.
