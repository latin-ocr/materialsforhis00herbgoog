This volume, like all the others in the series containing a miscellaneous selec-
tion of letters,-is valuable on account of the light it throws upon biographical
history, and the familiar view it presente of charactere, manners, and events.
The period requires much elucidation3 to which it will materially contribute.

The ‘⁶ Repressor ’⁹ may be considered the earliest piece of ood theologica] dis·
quisition of which our English prose literature can boast. he author was born
about the end of the fourteenth century, consecrated Bishop of St. Asaph in
the year 1444, and translated to the see of Chichester in 1450. While Bishop of
St. Asaph, he zealously defended his brother prelates from the attacks of those
who cenam-ed the bishops 181111811- neglect of duty. He maintained that it was no
part of abishop’s functions to appear in the pulpit, and that his time might be
more profitably spent, and his diguity better maintained, in the performance of.
works of a higher character. Among those who thought differently were the
Lollards, and against their general doctrines the ‘⁸ Repressor” is directed. Pecoek
took up a position midway between that of the Roman Church and that of the
modern Anglican Church ς but his work is interesting chiefly because it gives a
fun account of the views of the Lollards and of the arguments by which they were
supported, and because it assists us to ascertain the state of feeling which ulti-
mately led to the Reformation. Apart from religione matters, the light thrown upon
contemporaneous history is very small, but the “ Repressor '⁹ has eat valae
for the philologist, as it tells us what were the characteristica of the anguage in
use among the cultivated Englishmen of the fifteenth century. Pecock, though
an opponent of the 1181181118, shewed a certain spirit of toleration, for which he
received, towards the end of his life, the usual medioeval reward—persecution.

These annale, which are in Latin, commence in 447, and come down
to 1288. The earlier portion appears to be taken, from an lrish Chronicle,
used by Tigernach, and by the compilet of the Annals of Ulster. During its first
century it contains scarcely any-thing relating ιο Britain, the earliest direct
concuti-enee with English history 18 relative to the mission of Augustine.
Its notices throughout, though brief, are valuable. The annals were probably
written at St. Davids‚ by Blegewryd‚ Archdeacon of Llandaff, the most learned
man in his day in all Cymru.

These volumes contain the historical works of Gerald du Barry, who lived
in the reigns of Henry 11.. Richard 1., and John, and attempted to 111-8818111181]
the independence of Wales by restoring the see of St. David-s to its ancient
primacy. His works are of a very miscellaneous nature, both 111 prose and
verse, and are remarkable chiefly for the racy aud original anecdotes which
they contain relating to contemporaries. He is the only Welsh writer of any
importance who has contributed so much to the mediaeval literature of this
country, 81 assumed, in consequence of his nationality, so free and independent
a tone. His frequent travels in Italy, in Franco, in Ireland, andin Wales, gave
him opportunities sor observation which did not generally fall to the lot of mediaeval
writers in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and-of these observatione Giraldus
has made due use. Only extr-acts from these treatises have 'been printed before,
aad almost all of them are taken from unique manuscripts.
