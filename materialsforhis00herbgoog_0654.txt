“ would be an undertaking honourable to His MaJesty's reign, and conducive to
“ the advancement of historical and constitutional knowledge; that the House
‘⁸ therefore humbly besought His Majesty, that He would be graciousl pleased

{walbi-ud? ffeffissffssgssg very desirous that effect should be 'ven to the
resolution of the House of Commons, submitted to Her Ma esty's &heasury in
1857 a lan for the publication os the ancient chronicles an memoriale os the
United ingdom. and it was adopted accordingly. In selecting these works, it
was considered right, in the first instance, to 've preference to those of which
the manuscripts were unique, or the materia of which would help to fill up
blanks in English history for which no satisfactory and authentio information
hitherto existed in any accessible form. One great object the Master of the Rolls
had in view was to form a corpus historicum within reasonable limite, and which
should be as complete as ossible. Ina subject of so vast a range, it was im-
portant that the historica student should be able to select such volumes as
conformed with his own peculiar tastes and studies, and not be ut to the expense
of purchasing the whole collectiom an inconvenience insepara le from any other
plan than that which has been in this instance adopted.

Of the Chronioles and Memorials, the following volumes have been published.
'l'hey embraoe the riod from the earliest time of British history down to the
end of the reign o Henry VII.
