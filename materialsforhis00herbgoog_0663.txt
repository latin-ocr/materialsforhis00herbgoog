The nuthorship of the Chronicle in Vol. 1., hitherto ascribed to Geoffrey
Vincsau1,is nov more correctly ascribed to Richard, Canon of the noly Trinity
of London. The narrative extends stom 118? to ¹1⁹⁹3 but its chief interest
consists in the minute sud authentic narrative which it furnishes of the exploits
of Richard 1., from his departure stom England in December 1189 to his death
in 1199. The author states in his prologne that he vas sn eye-witness of much
thnt he records 3 and various incidentsl circumstances which occur m the course
of the narrative confirm this assertion.

'l'he letters in Vol. ΙΙ., written between 1187 and nvo, are of valae ,ς
furnishing authentic muterinls for the history of the ecclesiastical condition οἱ
Rngland during the reign ofRichnrd 1. They had their origin in a dispnte which
arone from the attempts of Baldvin end Hubert, srchbishops of Canterbury ιο
found a college of secular canons, s project which gave great umbi-age to ’the
monks of Gmterbnry, who sav in it s design to supplent them in their fonction
of metropolitan chapter. These letters are printed, for the first time, from s. MS.
belonging to the archiepiscopel libr-ary at Lambeth. ”
