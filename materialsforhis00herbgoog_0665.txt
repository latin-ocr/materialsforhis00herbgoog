The “ Book of Hyde '⁹ is a compilation from much earlier sources which am
usually indicated with considerable care and precision. In many canes, however,
the Hyde Chronicler appears to correct, to qnalify‚ or to amplify—either from
tradition or from sources of infamation not nov discoverable—-the statements,
which, in substance, he adopts. He alno mentione, and frequently quota stom
writers whose works are either entirely lost or at present known only by fragments.

There is to be found, in the “Book of Hyde,” much information relating to the
reign of King Alfred which is not known to exist elsewhere. The volume
contains some carious specimens of Anglo-Saxon and Mediaeval English.

There is, in this volume, a legendary account of the peopling of Irelnnd and of
the adventures which befell the various heroes who are said to have been eon-
nected with Irish history. The details are. however, very meagre both for this
period and for the time when history become: more anthentic. The plan adopted
in the chronicle gives the appearance of an accuracy to which the earlier portione
of the work cannot have any claim. The succession of eventa ia marked, ycatby

portion of the work are, the invasione of foreigners, and the ware of the Irish

The work in its present form, in the editor-'n opinion, is a comparatu-01y
modern version of un undoubtedly ancient orig‘iml. That it vas compiled from
contemporary materiale has been proved by curione incidental evidence. It is
stated in the account given of the battle of Clontarf that the rull tide in Dublin
Bay on the day of the battle (23 April 1014) coincided with sunrise3 and that
the returning tide in thc cvening aided considerably in the defeat of the Danes
The fact hae been verissed by astronomica! calculatione, and the infer-enee is
t'nat the author of the chroniele, if not an eye-witness,must have derived his iu..
formation from eye-witnesses. The contenta of the work arc sufficienrly
described in its title. The story is told after the manner of the Scadinavia„

sagas, with poema and fragments of poema introduced into the prosc narrative.
