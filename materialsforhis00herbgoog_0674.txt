This important and unique eurvey of the greater portion of England* is the
oldest and most veluable reeord in the nationul arohives. It was commeneed
about the year 1084 und fluiehed in 1086. Itu compilation was determinet! upon
at Gloueeeter by william the Conqueror, in eouneil, in order that he might
know what vas due to him, in the way of tax, from hie subjecte, and that each
at the eume time might know what he had to pay. It was compiled ae much
for their protection αι for the benefit of the eovereign. The nobility and people
hed been grievously distreesed at the time by the king bringing over large num-
bers of Freneh und Bretons, und quartering them ou his subjecte, “ each uoeord-
“ ing to the mensure of his lund,’' for the purpose of resistiug the invasion of
Cnut, King of Denmark, wh.eh was apprehended. The Commissioners appointed
to make the survey were to inquire the nume of euch plaee3 who held it in the
time of King Eds-rard the Confess0r3 the present possessor3 how many hides
were in the manor 3 how many ploughs were in the demesue 3 how many homagers3
how many villeine3 how many cottam3 how mun serving men ς how many free
tenunts 3 how many tenente in soceage3 how mucii wood‚ meadow, und pasture3
the number of mille and fieh ponds3 what had been added or taken away from
tho pluee3 what vas the gross velue in the time of Edwurd the Confesmr3 the
present value3 und how much each free man οι· soe-man had, end whether any
ndvunee could be made in the velue. Thus could be aseenained who held the
estate in the time of King Edem-<13 who then held it3 its velue in the time of
the late King3 end ite velue as it stood at the formation of the nurvey. So
minute vae the surrey, that the writer of the contemporary portion of the Suxon
Chroniele reem-ds, with nome severity—‘⁰ So very nurrowly he caused it to be
‘⁴ treeed out, that there was not u single hide, nor one vix-gete of land, nor even,
“ it is shame to tell, though it eeemed to him no theme to do, au ox, nor a cor,
“ nor a swine was lest, that was not set down?
