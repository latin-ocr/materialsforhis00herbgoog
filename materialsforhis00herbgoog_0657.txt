These Poems are perhaps the most interesting 01· all the historica] 'ritings of
the period, though they cannot be relied on for accuracy of statement. They
are various in character3 some arc upon religione subjecte, some may be called
satires, and some give no more than a court scandam but as a whole they pre-
sent a very fair picture of society, and of the relations of the different classes

to one another. The period comprised is in itself interesting, and brings us
through the decline 01· the feudal system, to the beginning oi· our modern
history. 'l'he sougs in old English are of considerable velue to the philologist.

it appears that he died. The latter portion 01· this history (the whole of the
reign 01· Edward 1. more especially) is 01· great velue, as the writer wss con-
temporary with the events which he reeords. An Appendix contains several
