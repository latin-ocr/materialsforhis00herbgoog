The Topographic Hibernice (in Vol. V.) is the result of Giraldun’ tvo vicit· to
[reland. The first in 1188,' the second in 1185-6, when he accompanied
Princo John into that country. Curious as thiu treatise is, Mt. 'Dimock is ol
opinion that it ought not to be accepted ae sober truthful history, for Giraldm
himself cutes thot trnth was not his main object, end that hc compiled the τοι-Β
for the purpose of sounding the praisce of Hem-y the Second. Elsewhere, hov-
ever, he declares that he had stated nothing in the Topogruphia of the math off
which he vas not well mund, either by his own eyecight or by the testimony.
with all diligence elicited, of the most trustworthy ⁶ and authentic men in the
country 3 that though he did not put just the same full seith in their reporto as
in what he had himself seen, yet, as they only related what they had themselves
seen, he could not but believe such credible witnesees. A very interesting portion
of this treatioe is devoted to the animale of Irelaud. It shows that he vae a very
accurate eud acute observet, and his description· are given in a way that a
scientific naturalist of the present day could hardly impr-ove upon. The Expug-
natio Hibernica vas written about 1188 and may be regarded rather as a
great epic than a sober relation of acts occurring in his own days. No one can
peruse it without coming to the conclusion that itis rather a poetica] fiction
than e prosaic truthful history. Vol. VI. contains the Itinerarium Kambrioe
et Descriptio Kambriaez and vol. VII„ the lives of S. Remigius and

S. Hugh.
