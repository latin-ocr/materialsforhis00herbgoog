The works to be published in octav0, separately, as
they were finished 3 thc whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editorS, who were tobe chosen by the
{Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Trcasury, after a careful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a

Treasury Minute‚ dated February 9, 1857, that the plan .

recommended by the Master of the Rolls “ was well
calculated for the accom pHslment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be

paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangement&
without unnecessary expense.’'

'They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each Chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct-
ness the text of each writer, derived from a collation of the
best MSS„ and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings They
suggested, however, that the presa-ce to each work should.
contain, in addition to the particulars proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author,
so far as authentic materiale existed for that purpose,
and an estimate of his historical credibility and value.
